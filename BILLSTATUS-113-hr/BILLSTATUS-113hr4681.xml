        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Bishop (NY) motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to ensure that the intelligence community continues to protect the United States from Chinese and other state sponsored computer theft by requiring that it: 1) consistent with existing law, immediately inform corporations and internet providers of any computer breaches and the steps necessary to combat further intrusion; 2) coordinate with other Federal agencies to protect the United States infrastructure; and 3) assist the Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies, including supporting allies of the United States in efforts to punish and sanction individuals and government that perpetrate espionage and identity theft.</text>
