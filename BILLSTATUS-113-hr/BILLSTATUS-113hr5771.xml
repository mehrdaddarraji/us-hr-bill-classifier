        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Neal motion to recommit with instructions, pending reservation of a point order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to deny any "inverted" corporations that change their residence from the United States in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes from receiving the tax benefits made available in the underlying legislation. Subsequently, the reservation of a point of order was withdrawn.</text>

A bill summary describes the most significant provisions of a piece of legislation and details the effects the legislative text may have on current law and federal programs. Bill summaries are authored by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Congress. As stated in Public Law 91-510 (2 USC 166 (d)(6)), one of the duties of CRS is "to prepare summaries and digests of bills and resolutions of a public general nature introduced in the Senate or House of Representatives".
