Requires the Corps to: (1) facilitate the expeditious resolution of the environmental review process and complete documents required by NEPA, (2) identify agencies that may have jurisdiction over a water resources project, (3) establish a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in and comment on the environmental review process for a project study, (4) identify issues of concern regarding the potential environmental or socioeconomic impacts of a project, and (5) prepare a condensed final environmental impact statement under NEPA. </p> <p>Requires the Secretary to survey the use by the Corps of categorical exclusions (i.e., a category of actions that do not have a significant effect on the human environment and do not require an environmental assessment or impact statement) in water resources projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) Repeals provisions of the WRDA of 1986 that require : (1) a reconnaissance study of a water resources project prior to initiating a feasibility study for such project, and (2) a review of the cost effectiveness of the design of a water resources project that has a total cost in excess of $10 million. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to: (1) expedite the completion of any ongoing feasibility study for a water resources project initiated before the enactment of this Act, and (2) proceed directly to preconstruction planning, engineering, and design of the project in accordance with the WRDA of 1986 if the Secretary determines that the project is justified. <br> <br> (Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary to establish a process for the review of section 14 applications in a timely and consistent manner. Defines "section 14 application" as an application submitted to the Secretary requesting permission for the temporary occupation or use of a public work or the alteration or permanent occupation or use of a public work.

        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with one hour of debate on Sean Maloney (NY) motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 3080. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 3080 be instructed to recede from disagreement with the provisions contained in title IX of the Senate amendment (relating to reducing the risks to life and property from dam failure in the United States through reauthorization of an effective dam safety program).</text>
