The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the managers on the part of the House to recede to section 1602 of the Senate amendment (relating to suspension of permanent price support authority), and recede to the Senate position in title IV of the Senate amendment providing at a minimum a five-year duration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other nutrition programs.</text>

        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Esty motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct annual audits of the food regulatory systems for each country that is eligible to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the United States. The motion would also give the Secretary the authority to transfer funds from any Department of Agriculture account to the Food Safety and Inspection Service account in order to address any food safety emergency.</text>
