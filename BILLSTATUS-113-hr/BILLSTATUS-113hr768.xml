Requires states to report student attendance rates, disaggregated by each school and each teacher and principal at each school within specified jurisdictions.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) recognize each LEA that has innovative, high-quality, and effective teacher or principal evaluation programs that lead to professional development and improved student performance; and (2) establish a clearinghouse to share the best practices of such programs with educators.<br> </p>]]></text>
