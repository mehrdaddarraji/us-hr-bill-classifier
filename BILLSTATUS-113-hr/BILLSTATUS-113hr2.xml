        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Schneider motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to add a new division at the end of the bill. The new division contains provisions to police excessive speculation in energy markets, protect national security, and prohibit expedited permitting for corporations that relase toxic air pollutants from petroleum coke.</text>
