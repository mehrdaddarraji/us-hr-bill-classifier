          <text><![CDATA[<p>Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to revise the requirement of a 48-hour notification of a campaign contribution of $1,000 or more to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and certain other officials by the principal campaign committee of a candidate for federal office.</p> <p>Applies this requirement, with certain additions, but for reporting exclusively to the FEC, to any political committee regarding cumulative contributions of $1,000 or more from any contributor during a calendar year.</p> <p>(Currently, a candidate's principal campaign committee is required to give a written 48-hour notification to the Secretary of the Senate or the FEC, and the Secretary of State, as appropriate, after the receipt of any contribution of $1,000 or more by any authorized committee of such candidate after the 20th day, but more than 48 hours before, any election.)</p> <p>Treats any amount transferred by a joint fundraising committee established by a candidate's authorized committee to any other authorized committee of that candidate as a contribution by the joint fundraising committee to such authorized committee (and thus subject to the 48-hour notification requirement). <p>Requires Senate candidates to file designations, statements, and reports directly with the FEC (instead of via the Secretary of the Senate, as currently required).</p>]]></text>
