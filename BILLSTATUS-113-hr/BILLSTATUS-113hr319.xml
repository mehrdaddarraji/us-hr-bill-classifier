          <text><![CDATA[<p>Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to revise the contents of the concurrent resolution on the budget to include a heading entitled &quot;Debt Increase as Measure of Deficit&quot; to set forth the amounts by which the current $14.294 trillion public debt limit shall increase in each of such years.</p> <p>Declares that, upon passage in the House of Representatives of the conference report on any concurrent budget resolution, it shall be immediately in order for the House to consider a privileged bill offered by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget amending the public debt limit at the level proposed under the &quot;Debt Increase as Measure of Deficit&quot; heading for the budget resolution's fiscal year. Limits to one hour any debate on the bill. Prohibits the measure from being amendable and a motion to commit from being in order.</p> <p>Applies similar procedures for Senate consideration of the House passed bill.</p> <p>Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider the bill before the passage of the conference report on the budget resolution for its fiscal year.</p> <p>Increases the public debt limit from $14,294,000,000,000 to $17,072,810,000,000.</p> </p>]]></text>
