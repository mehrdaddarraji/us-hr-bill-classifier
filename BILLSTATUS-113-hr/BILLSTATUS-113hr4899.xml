        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Bishop (NY) motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to prohibit major integrated oil companies from receiving new leases in the areas covered by the underlying bill unless they enter into an agreement under which they are prohibited from claiming the domestic production activities deduction under Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment also requires that any lease issued pursuant to the underlying bill specify that crude oil or natural gas produced under such lease may be exported only if the Secretary of the Interior determines that exporting such commodities will not increase the price of gasoline or home heating oil for American consumers.</text>
