          <text><![CDATA[<p>Postal Facilities Preservation and Sales Reform Act - Revises requirements for making a determination as to the necessity for&nbsp;closing or consolidating any postal facility to require that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS): (1) hold at least three public meetings, located in the area affected by the closing or consolidation, at least 120 days prior to the determination; and (2) provide adequate notice of the closing or consolidation to persons served by such facility&nbsp;at least 180 days prior to the proposed date of such closing or consolidation. </p> <p>Prohibits USPS from entering into any contract or agreement to sell or relocate a historic postal facility until the proposed decision to sell or relocate is reviewed in accordance with requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act. </p> <p>Requires USPS to use the Historic Surplus Property Program to dispose of a historic postal facility that has been determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer or the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places to be of national significance. Requires: (1) the Postmaster General to maintain a list of historic postal facilities and to publish such list on the USPS website, (2) the Postmaster General to maintain a separate preservation budget for such facilities, and (3) the USPS Federal Preservation Officer to notify the National Museum of American Art when New Deal art (art located at a postal facility that was commissioned by the federal government between 1933 and 1937)&nbsp;owned by USPS is loaned or relocated.</p> <p>Requires the Postmaster General to develop a model covenant to be used and applied to any historic postal facility offered for sale that: (1) requires the purchaser of such a facility to allow public access to any historic artwork located within such facility, (2) requires USPS&nbsp;to contribute sufficient funds to the maintenance of such artwork, and (3) prohibits the purchaser of the historic postal facility from demolishing or altering&nbsp;it in any way that is incompatible with its historic character. </p> <p>Nullifies the proposed rule published&nbsp;by USPS in&nbsp;the Federal Register on January 13, 2014, relating to a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act for disposal of USPS facilities. </p>]]></text>
