I,Sec. 8, of the Constitution.In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 91 (1976), the SupremeCourt upheld the congressional power to enact publicfinancing of presidential elections under this Clause. TheSupreme Court stated with regard to the provisions in theFederal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 establishinga presidential public financing system, ``In this case,Congress was legislating for the `general welfare'--to reducethe deleterious influence of large contributions on ourpolitical process, to facilitate communication by candidateswith the electorate, and to free candidates from the rigorsof fundraising.''[Page H7891]</pre>]]></constitutionalAuthorityStatementText>
