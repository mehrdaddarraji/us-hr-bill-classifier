          <text><![CDATA[<p>Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act - <strong>Title I: Central Valley Project Water Reliability</strong> - Amends the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) to include among the Act's purposes: (1) to ensure that water dedicated to fish and wildlife purposes is replaced and provided to Central Valley Project (CVP) water contractors by December 31, 2018, at the lowest cost reasonably achievable, and (2) to facilitate and expedite water transfers in accordance with that Act. Redefines "anadromous fish" for purposes of such Act. Defines "reasonable flows" as water flows capable of being maintained taking into account competing consumptive uses of water and economic, environmental, and social factors.</p> <p>Eliminates existing limitations on the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to enter into any new contracts for water supply from the CVP. Directs the Secretary to renew any existing long-term repayment or water service contract, upon request of the contractor, that provides for the delivery of water from the CVP for a period of 40 years (the current contractual term is 25 years). Requires new or renewed contracts to include a provision that requires the Secretary to charge only for water actually delivered.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to take all necessary actions to facilitate and expedite CVP water transfers in accordance with such Act or any other provision of federal reclamation law and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).</p> <p>Grants the Secretary discretion to modify CVP operations to provide reasonable water flows of suitable quality, quantity, and timing to protect all life stages of anadromous fish.</p> <p>Repeals a requirement that not less than 67% of all funds made available to the Restoration Fund under CVPIA be authorized to be appropriated to carry out habitat restoration, improvement, and acquisition provisions of that Act.</p> <p>Requires the CVP and the California State Water Project (SWP) to be operated pursuant to the water quality standards and operational constraints described in the "Principles for Agreement of the Bay-Delta Standards Between the State of California and the Federal Government," dated December 15, 1994 (Bay-Delta Accord of 1994), without regard to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) or any other law pertaining to the operation of the CVP and the SWP.</p> <p>Prohibits the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce from distinguishing between natural-spawned and hatchery-spawned or otherwise artificially propagated strains of a species in making any determination under ESA that relates to any anadromous fish species that are present in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers or their tributaries and that ascend those rivers and their tributaries to reproduce after maturing in the San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean.</p> <p>Adds the Kettleman City Community Services District as an authorized service area of the CVP. Directs the Secretary to enter into a long-term contract for the delivery of up to 900 acre-feet of CVP water for municipal and industrial use.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to offer to the Oakdale Irrigation District, the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, and the Calaveras County Water District a contract enabling such districts to collectively impound and store a portion of their Stanislaus River water rights in the New Melones Reservoir in accordance with applicable terms of the Warren Act. </p> <p>Establishes a pilot program to remove non-native predatory fish from the Stanislaus River. </p> <p>Directs the Secretary, if the San Luis Reservoir does not fill by the last day of February, to permit any entity with an agricultural water service or repayment contract for the delivery of water from the Delta Division or the San Luis Unit to reschedule into the immediately following contract year (i.e., March 1 through the last day of February) any unused CVP water previously allocated for irrigation purposes. </p> <p><strong>Title II: San Joaquin River Restoration</strong> - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to cease any action to implement the Stipulation of Settlement dated September 13, 2006, in the litigation entitled Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v. Kirk Rodgers, et al., U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California. </p> <p>Amends the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act to eliminate references to such Stipulation of Settlement and to direct the Secretary, beginning on March 1, 2015, to modify Friant Dam operations to release restoration flows in a manner that improves the fishery in the San Joaquin River between Friant Dam and Gravelly Ford. Directs the Secretary, prior to October 1, 2015, to: (1) identify the impacts associated with the release of such restoration flows; (2) identify measures necessary to mitigate impacts on adjacent and downstream water users, landowners, and agencies as a result of such restoration flows; and (3) implement all such mitigation measures identified before such restoration flows are commenced.</p> <p>Repeals provisions relating to settlement of litigation regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon into such River.</p> <p><strong>Title III: Repayment Contracts and Acceleration of Repayment of Construction Costs</strong> - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, upon request of the contractor, to convert all existing long-term CVP contracts to contracts that require a contractor to pay the remaining balance of construction at a Treasury rate discount. </p> <p><strong>Title IV: Bay-Delta Watershed Water Rights Preservation and Protection</strong> - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, federal reclamation law, or the ESA), in the operation of CVP, to: (1) strictly adhere to state water rights law governing water rights priorities by honoring water rights senior to those belonging to CVP, regardless of the source of priority; and (2) strictly adhere to and honor water rights and other priorities that are obtained or that exist under the California Water Code. Requires any action taken by the Secretary or the Secretary of Commerce to protect any species listed under the ESA that affects the diversion of water or involves the release of water from any CVP water storage facility to be applied in a manner that is consistent with water rights priorities established by state law.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce, in implementing the ESA in the Bay-Delta and on the Sacramento River, to apply any limitations on the operation of CVP or to formulate any reasonable prudent alternative associated with CVP's operation in a manner that strictly adheres to and applies water rights priorities for project water and base supply provided for in the Sacramento River settlement contracts.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary, subject to the absolute priority of Sacramento River settlement contractors, to allocate water provided for irrigation purposes to existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to ensure that there are no redirected adverse water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River or San Joaquin River watershed or to the SWP arising from the Secretary's operation of CVP to meet legal obligations.</p> <p><strong>Title V: Miscellaneous</strong> - Declares that: (1) coordinated operations between CVP and SWP, previously requested and consented to by the state of California and the federal government, require assertion of federal supremacy to protect existing water rights throughout the system; (2) these circumstances are unique to California; and (3) nothing in this Act shall serve as precedent in any other state.</p> <p>Declares that this Act shall not affect the Proclamation of State of Emergency and the associated executive order issued on January 17, 2014, by the Governor of California. </p> <p>Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to: (1) decrease the length of a segment of the Lower Merced River in California designated as a wild and scenic river; and (2) revise provisions concerning the water surface level of Lake McClure in Mariposa County, California.</p>]]></text>

Requires new or renewed contracts to include a provision that requires the Secretary to charge only for water actually delivered.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to take all necessary actions to facilitate and expedite CVP water transfers in accordance with CVPIA or any other provision of federal reclamation law and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Requires: (1) the contracting district from which the water is coming, the agency, or the Secretary to determine if a written water transfer proposal is complete within 45 days after the date of submission of such proposal; and (2) the district, agency, or Secretary to state with specificity what must be added or revised if such proposal is determined to be incomplete.</p> <p>Prohibits the Secretary from imposing mitigation or other requirements on a proposed transfer of water.</p> <p>Declares that: (1) the authority to make transfers or exchanges of, or banking or recharge arrangements using, CVP water that could have been conducted before October 30, 1992, is valid and such transfers, exchanges, or arrangements shall not be subject to, limited, or conditioned by this title; and (2) this title shall not supersede or revoke the authority to transfer, exchange, bank, or recharge CVP water that existed prior to such date.</p> <p>Requires: (1) measurement (currently, metering) of water use; and (2) the contracting district or agency, excluding districts serving multiple agencies with separate governing boards, to ensure that all contractor-owned water delivery systems within its boundaries measure surface water at the district or agency's facilities up to the point the surface water is commingled with other water supplies.</p> <p>Repeals provisions regarding water pricing reform. Requires all revenues received by the Secretary that exceed the cost-of-service to be covered to the CVP Restoration Fund.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) Grants the Secretary discretion to modify CVP operations to provide reasonable water flows of suitable quality, quantity, and timing to protect all life stages of anadromous fish. Provides that instream flow needs for CVP controlled streams and rivers shall be determined by the Secretary based on recommendations of the National Marine Fisheries Service (as well as recommendations of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service), after consultation with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (currently, consultation is required with the California Department of Fish and Game).</p> <p>Provides that all CVP water used for purposes specified in CVPIA shall be credited to the quantity of CVP yield dedicated and managed under that Act by determining how the dedication and management of such water would affect the delivery capability of the CVP during the 1928 to 1934 drought period after fishery, water quality, and other flow and operational requirements imposed by terms and conditions existing in agreements pertaining to CVP under applicable law existing on October 30, 1992, have been met. Requires CVP water to be reused to fulfill the secretary's remaining contractual obligations to provide CVP water for agricultural or municipal and industrial purposes.</p> <p>States that: (1) if, by March 15th of any year, the quantity of CVP water forecasted to be made available to water service or repayment contractors in the Delta Division of CVP is below 75% of the total quantity made available under such contracts, the quantity of CVP yield dedicated and managed for that year shall be reduced by 25%; and (2) by pursuing activities described in this section, the Secretary shall be deemed to have met the mitigation, protection, restoration, and enhancement purposes of this title.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) Repeals a requirement that not less than 67% of all funds made available to the Restoration Fund under CVPIA be authorized to be appropriated to carry out habitat restoration, improvement, and acquisition provisions of that Act.</p> <p>Prohibits the Secretary from requiring: (1) a donation or other payment to the Fund or environmental restoration or mitigation fees not otherwise provided by law as a condition to providing for storage or conveyance of non-CVP water or for the delivery of water pursuant to the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, or (2) a donation or other payment to the Fund for any water that is delivered with the sole intent of groundwater recharge. Requires annual payments to the Fund to be allocated so as not to exceed $4 per megawatt-hour for CVP power sold to power contractors (October 2015 price levels) after October 1, 2015.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to: (1) reduce certain sums and payment ceilings for the Fund upon the completion of certain fish, wildlife, and habitat mitigation and restoration actions by no later than December 31, 2020; and (2) submit a plan for Fund expenditures, including a cost effectiveness analysis of each expenditure. Establishes a Restoration Fund Advisory Board to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding priorities and spending levels on projects and programs under CVPIA.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary to: (1) use the authority granted in the CVPIA in connection with requests to exchange, impound, store, carry, or deliver nonproject water using CVP facilities for any beneficial purpose; and (2) develop rates not to exceed the amount required to recover the reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary in connection with a beneficial purpose.
