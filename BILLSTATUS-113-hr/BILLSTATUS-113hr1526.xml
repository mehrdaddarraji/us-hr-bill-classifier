          <text><![CDATA[<p>Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act - <b>Title I: Restoring the Commitment to Rural Counties and Schools</b> - (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (the Secretary in this title) to establish at least one Forest Reserve Revenue Area (Area) within each unit of the National Forest System (NFS) designated for sustainable forest management for the production of national forest materials (the sale of trees, portions of trees, or forest products from NFS lands) and forest reserve revenues (to be derived from the sale of such materials in such an Area). </p> <p>States that the purpose of an Area is to provide a dependable source of 25% payments and economic activity for each beneficiary county containing NFS land that was eligible to receive payments through its state under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. </p> <p>Requires the Secretary to determine the annual volume requirement for each Area. </p> <p>Prohibits the Secretary from reducing the number of acres of NFS land in an Area once it has been established. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) Instructs the Secretary to: (1) manage Areas in the manner necessary to achieve their annual volume requirement (a volume of national forest materials at least 50% of the Area's sustained yield), and (2) conduct covered forest reserve projects within those Areas in accordance with this section, which shall serve as the only means by which the Secretary will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and other applicable laws. Defines &quot;covered forest reserve project&quot; as one involving the management or sale of national forest materials within an Area to generate forest reserve revenues and achieve its annual volume requirement. </p> <p>Requires the Secretary to complete an environmental assessment for a covered forest reserve project proposed for an Area, but does not require the Secretary to study, develop, or describe any alternative to the proposed agency action. </p>   <p>Makes the decision notice for a covered reserve project the final agency action, and prohibits the requirement of any additional analysis under NEPA to implement any part of the covered project. </p> <p>Excludes categorically from NEPA requirements a covered forest reserve project proposed in response to a catastrophic event, that covers an area of up to 10,000 acres, or an eligible hazardous fuel reduction or forest health project involving the removal of insect-infested trees, dead or dying trees, trees presenting a threat to public safety, or other hazardous fuels within 500 feet of utility or telephone infrastructure, campgrounds, roadsides, heritage sites, recreation sites, schools, or other infrastructure.</p> <p>(A &quot;categorical exclusion&quot; under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.) </p> <p>Requires the Secretary, if a proposed covered forest reserve project may affect the continued existence of endangered or threatened species, to issue a determination explaining that the proposed covered project is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Requires a written response from the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate, including, if it rejects that determination, recommendations for measures that will avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to an endangered or threatened species. </p> <p>Prescribes requirements for administrative and judicial reviews of a covered forest reserve project. </p> <p>Permits the use of all-terrain vehicles within Areas for the purpose of activities associated with the sale of national forest materials. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Requires forest reserve revenues to be used to make: (1) 25% payments to states for the benefit ofbeneficiary counties, and (2) deposits into the Knutson-Vandenburg Fund and the salvage sale fund in contributions equal to the monies collected under such Acts for projects conducted on System NFS land.</p> <p>Requires the deposit of remaining forest reserve revenues into the Treasury's general fund.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) Prescribes requirements for annual reports for each Area.</p> <p><b>Title II: Healthy Forest Management and Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention </b>- (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to NFS land, and the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to public lands, to implement a hazardous fuel reduction project or forest health project in at-risk forests in a manner that focuses on surface, ladder, and canopy fuels reduction activities. </p> <p>Permits a hazardous fuel reduction project or a forest health project to include livestock grazing and timber harvest projects carried out for purposes of hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, forest restoration, watershed restoration, or threatened and endangered species habitat protection or improvement, if the management action is consistent with achieving long-term ecological restoration. </p>    <p>(Sec. 204) Applies the environmental assessment requirements of title I to the implementation of a hazardous fuel reduction project or a forest health project under this title. </p> <p>Exempts such a project from judicial review or any federal court injunction if its primary purpose is the salvage of dead, damaged, or down timber resulting from wildfire occurring in 2013. </p> <p>(Sec. 205) Allows a state governor to designate high-risk areas of federal land in the state for purposes of addressing: (1) deteriorating forest health conditions due to the bark beetle epidemic or drought, with the resulting imminent risk of devastating wildfires; and (2) the future risk of insect infestations or disease outbreaks through preventative treatments to improve forest health conditions. </p> <p> Prohibits the following federal land from being designated as a high-risk area: (1) a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, (2) federal land on which the removal of vegetation is specifically prohibited by federal statute, and (3) federal land within a National Monument. </p> <p>Requires the first high-risk areas, for 20 years duration, to be designated within 60 days of enactment of this Act but permits the designation of high-risk areas at any time. </p>  <p>Declares that designation of a high-risk area shall not be construed to limit or restrict: (1) access to federal land included in the area for hunting, fishing, and other related purposes;
