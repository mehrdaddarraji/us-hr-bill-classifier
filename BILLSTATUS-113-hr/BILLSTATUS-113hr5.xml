        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Kuster motion to recommit with instructions pending a reservation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to prevent lowering standards for children with disabilities, including autistic children. It establishes safety standards for the use of seclusion and restraint in schools so children are not physically and mentally harmed. It also establishes standards for protecting student athletes from concussions. Lastly, it provides for criminal background checks of school and contractor employees who have contact with children. Subsequently, the reservation of a point of order was withdrawn.</text>
