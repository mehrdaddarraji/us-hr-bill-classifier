Requires the Assistant Secretary to have substantial experience in workforce development and in workforce development management. <p>(Sec. 134) Revises the requirement that funds made available to a state for administration of statewide workforce investment activities be allocable to the overall administration of workforce investment activities. Repeals the declaration that such funds need not be specifically allocable to: (1) the administration of adult employment and training activities; (2) the administration of dislocated worker employment and training activities; or (3) the administration of youth activities. <p>(Sec. 135) Requires that each state, each local board, and each recipient (other than a subrecipient, subgrantee, or contractor of a recipient) receiving funds have the option to submit or disseminate electronically any reports, records, plans, or any other data required to be collected or disseminated. <p>Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress all quarterly financial reports of local boards on programs and activities received from each state. <p>(Sec. 136) Changes from July 1 to October 1 the start of a workforce investment systems program year. <p>Repeals special rules for: (1) designation of service delivery areas for the delivery of workforce investment activities, and (2) state sanctioning of such areas for failure to meet performance measures for such activities. <p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to establish, in lieu of current requirements for waiver requests and for conditions on waivers, an expedited procedure for the purpose of extending to additional states the waiver of statutory or regulatory requirements that have been approved for a state pursuant to a request. <p>Prohibits the Secretary from requiring or imposing new or additional requirements, not specified under this Act, on a state in exchange for providing a waiver to the state or a local area in it. <p>(Sec. 138) Exempts certain funds received by a public or private nonprofit entity, such as those raised privately from philanthropic foundations, businesses, or other private entities, from consideration as income with respect to the requirement that a public or private nonprofit entity may retain income from any program it administers only if it is used to continue to carry out the program. <p>Prohibits the use of funds to establish or operate stand-alone fee-for-service enterprises, except one-stop centers, that compete with private sector employment agencies. <p>(Sec. 139) Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) identify the number of federal government employees who work on or administer each of the workforce investment system programs authorized or repealed under this Act, (2) identify the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees who work on or administer any such programs that have been repealed or consolidated, and (3) reduce the federal government workforce by that number of FTE employees. <p>Prohibits the use of funds for lobbying (with specified exceptions) and political activities (including voter registration activities). <p><b>Subtitle F: State Unified Plan</b> - (Sec. 140) Revises the kinds of programs and activities, including workforce investment system and adult education and literacy programs, that may be covered by a state unified plan. <p> Grants the Secretary of Education the authority to approve state unified plans. (Currently, such plans are approved by the appropriate Secretary of the federal agency who exercises administrative authority over such programs or activities.) Prescribes requirements for the Secretary's approval of such plans. <p>Authorizes a state, in developing a state unified plan, to consolidate additional federal employment and training funds allotted to it into the Workforce Investment Fund to improve the administration of state and local employment and training programs. Prohibits consolidation of funds, however, allocated to the state under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <p><b>Title II: Adult Education and Family Literacy Education</b> - (Sec. 201) Revises the entire Adult Education and Family Literacy Education Act (while retaining most of it as is). <p>Defines &quot;adult education and family literacy education programs&quot; as a sequence of academic instruction and educational services below the postsecondary level that increase an individual's ability to read, write, and speak English and perform mathematical computations leading to a level of proficiency equivalent to at least a secondary school completion. Targets these programs to individuals who are at least age 16 and are not enrolled or required to be enrolled in secondary school under state law and who also: (1) lack sufficient mastery of basic reading, writing, speaking, and math skills to enable them to function effectively in society; (2) do not have a secondary school diploma or its equivalent and have not achieved an equivalent level of education; or (3) are English learners. <p>Changes the term &quot;individual of limited English proficiency&quot; to &quot;English learner.&quot; <p>Extends the authorization of appropriations through FY2014-FY2020. <p>Increases from 1.5% to 2% the mandatory reservation of funds for national activities involved in adult education, English language acquisition, and family literacy education programs. <p>Replaces current requirements for a performance accountability system with a referral to specified other performance accountability requirements. <p>Contracts from five years to three years the length of the mandatory state plan. Authorizes the eligible agency to submit the state plan as part of a state unified plan (as indicated in Sec. 140). Revises requirements for plan contents. Requires the Secretary to approve a state plan within 90 days after receiving it. Reduces from 90 days to 30 days the deadline for rejecting a plan for failing to meet requirements. Requires the Secretary, however, to provide technical assistance to assist the eligible agency to meet such requirements if its plan fails to receive approval. <p>Revises requirements for local activities the eligible agency must require eligible providers receiving a grant or contract to establish or operate.

        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the George Miller (CA) motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to ensure that nothing in the underlying bill repeals, denies, or weakens the wages, employment protections, employment or training opportunities for seniors, disabled veterans, women in nontraditional occupations, youth, or people with disabilities. The Motion would also raise the minimum wage, in increments over the course of two years, to $10.10 and increase the minimum wage for tipped employees to 70% of the minimum wage.</text>
