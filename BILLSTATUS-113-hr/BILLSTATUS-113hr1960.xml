        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Duckworth motion to recommit with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to require that for any sexual assault or sex-related offense, the commander refers the charges to the staff judge advocate. If the victim chooses not to pursue the case through the commander, the victim can seek to refer the charges to the Office of the Chief Prosecutor of the armed force of which the accused is a member. Finally, the motion would require any armed force which does not currently have a Chief Prosecutor to appoint one.</text>
