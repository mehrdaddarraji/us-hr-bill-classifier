        <purpose>An amendment No. 15 printed in Part A of House Rept. 113-460 to create a moratorium on the insourcing of previously contracted activities within DOD. Exceptions would be made (1) if the activity was "inherently governmental", and thereby should never have been contracted out in the first place; and (2) if DOD would employ a "reverse A-76" to itemize specific costs saved to the taxpayer should the DOD be able to perform the commercial activity more efficiently for the taxpayer.</purpose>

        <description>Amendment sought to create a moratorium on the insourcing of previously contracted activities within DOD with exceptions made (1) if the activity was "inherently governmental"; and (2) if DOD would employ a "reverse A-76" to itemize specific costs saved to taxpayers should DOD be able to perform the commercial activity more efficiently.</description>

        <purpose>An amendment No. 15 printed in Part A of House Rept. 113-460 to create a moratorium on the insourcing of previously contracted activities within DOD. Exceptions would be made (1) if the activity was "inherently governmental", and thereby should never have been contracted out in the first place; and (2) if DOD would employ a "reverse A-76" to itemize specific costs saved to the taxpayer should the DOD be able to perform the commercial activity more efficiently for the taxpayer.</purpose>

        <description>Amendment sought to authorize DOD to work with African countries to provide support in dealing with violent extremist organizations that illegally poach animals to generate revenue as a means of existence and to provide intelligence on ways to prevent such poaching. As modified, the amendment changes a reference in the text of the amendment from "Afghan Security Forces" to "African Union Standby Force (ASF)". (See page H4712 of the Congressional Record for May 21, 2014, for explanation of vacating demand for a recorded vote.).</description>
