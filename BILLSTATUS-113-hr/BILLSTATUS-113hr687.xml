    <constitutionalAuthorityStatementText><![CDATA[<pre>[Pages H547-H548]By Mr. GOSAR:H.R. 687.Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuantto the following:Article IV of the Constitution provides the authority ofCongress over federal property as a general matter. ArticleIV, Sec. 3 refers to the managerial authority over propertyowned by the Federal Government, and provides in relevantpart:The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make allneedful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory orother Property belonging to the United States; . . .By virtue of this enumerated power, Congress has governingauthority over the lands, territories, or other property ofthe United States--and with this authority Congress is vestedwith the power accredited to all owners in fee, the power tosell, lease, dispose,[[Page H548]]exchange, transfer, trade, mine, or simply preserve land. Theappropriate acreage to be held under Federal dominance is notthe subject of this bill. Turning to the power of Article IV,Sec. 3, the Supreme Court has described this enumerated grantas one ``without limitation'' Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S.529, 542-543 (1976) (``And while the furthest reaches of thepower granted by the Property Clause have not yet beendefinitively resolved, we have repeatedly observed that`[t]he power over the public land thus entrusted to Congressis without limitations' '' Citing United States v. SanFrancisco, 310 U.S. 29. The Court in Kleppe further explainedthat ``In short, Congress exercises the powers both of aproprietor and of a legislature over the public domain.'' Id.Like any ``propiretor'' Congress has the power to sell orexchange federal property.It is now generally accepted that the Federal Governmentmay own and manage property in the manner and form mandatedby Congress. United States v. Gratiot, 39 U.S. 526 (1840);Camfield v. United States, 167 U.S. 518 (1897). However, thewisdom of the Federal Government owning large tracts of land,particularly in the Western States, is subject to question onpolicy grounds, and some contend on Constitutional groundsbased on the decision in Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 44 U.S.212 (where the Court stated that ``a proper examination ofthis subject will show that the United States never held anymunicipal sovereignty, jurisdiction, or right of soil in andto the territory of which Alabama or any of the new Stateswere formed, except for temporary purposes . . . .''Historically, the early federal government transferredownership of federal property to either private ownership orto state ownership in order to pay off the then crushingRevolutionary War debts and to assist with the development ofinfrastructure. These are still acceptable goals for federalproperty sale or transfer.The land exchange here is one that comports with goodpolicy and constitutional strictures since by exchanging theland set forth in this bill, a large commercial grade coppermine will be able to proceed with the attendant economicbenefits with which such a proposition inures (assumingcompliance with other requirements set forth in the bill),but the Federal Government also gains equally valuable landthat has significance for other purposes.Article 1, Sec. 8, Cl. 17 addresses property ceded by astate and conveys exclusive regulatory federal jurisdictionover these federal properties and enclaves. Section 8, Cl, 17may also provide some guidance here to the extent it grantsCongress the power to ``exercise like Authority over allPlaces purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of theState in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts,Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards and other needfulBuildings.'' But it is Article IV that this bill is groundedupon.</pre>]]></constitutionalAuthorityStatementText>
